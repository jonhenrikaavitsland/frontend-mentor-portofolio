## My process

I started with sketching on a piece of paper while looking at the figma file trying to get the best start possible. Then i wrote the HTML and then i wrote the CSS. I found that I had very little to change in the markup.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about background images and hover states. I have grown more confident in layout. I also learned more about the unit em and how it works properly.
