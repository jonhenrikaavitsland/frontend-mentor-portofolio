## My process
I used figma to get the extra information that i needed and then i coded it in VSCode.
I started by writing the HTML and then i wrote the CSS while checking my progress in a live-server. 

  ### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox

  ### What I learned
  I have grown a little more confident in using flexbox.

  ### Continued development
  I will continue to put focus on layouts in flex and grid.

  ### Useful resources
  MDN
